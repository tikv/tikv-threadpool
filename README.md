# yatp
Yet another thread pool in Rust that is adaptive, responsive and generic.

_It is still a work in progress._

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tikv/yatp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tikv/yatp)

## Features

* **Adaptive**: Yatp adjusts the number of working threads automatically. Under
  light workloads, unnecessary context switches are greatly reduced.

* **Responsive**: Yatp supports different kinds of task queues with advanced
  scheduling algorithms like [multi-level feedback queue][MLFQ].

* **Generic**: Yatp is easily adapted to various tasks. Simple callbacks,
  [futures 0.3] and [std Future] are built-in supported.
